          In my free time, I enjoy expressing myself through music by playing the violin,<br>
           which helps me relax and sharpen my focus, while also allowing me to be creative
           in<br> a different way. I also love gaming, as it challenges my strategic thinking,
           problem-solving<br> skills, and teamwork, while providing a fun and engaging way to 
           unwind. Together, these hobbies<br> balance creativity and logic, keeping me motivated
            and inspired both mentally and emotionally.
